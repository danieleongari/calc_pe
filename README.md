# Instructions on how to use improved_calPE.py to calculate the Parasitic Energy

1. To use improved_calPE.py, you will first have to install the pyIAST python package. 
Instructions on how to download the program can be found here: http://pyiast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Link to the Github page: https://github.com/CorySimon/pyIAST

2. To run the program, enter the following command into the command line:

```shell
./improved_calPE.py coreDB.yml ABAVIJ coal IAST IAST
```

### Explanation of the input:

* improved_calPE.py is program to calculate the parasitic energy
* coreDB.yml is the database
* ABAVIJ is the name of the structure for which you want to calculate the parasitic energy
* coal is the composition of the gas
* IAST is the mixed-gas model
* IAST is the name of the dictionary key

3. The output you get should look like something like this:

```shell
ABAVIJ [914.4198, 2026.5, 333.0, 0.248214, 192.9399, 721.48,43.1682, 0.98971, 0.924254]
```

### Explanation of the output:

* ABAVIJ is the name of the structure
* 914.4198 is the parasitic energy in kJ/kg
* 2026.5 is the pressure (Pa)
* 333.0 is the final temperature (K)
* 0.248214 is the fraction of final electricity loss (-)
* 192.9399 is the final heat requirement (kJ/kg)
* 721.48 Ã  final compression work (kJ/kg)
* 43.1682 is the final mass of CO2 produced (kg)
* 0.98971 is the final working capacity (mol/kg)
* 0.924254 is the fraction of the final purity CO2 (-)

### NB: 

* The isotherm data should be put in the ccsdata/structure_name folder 
(e.g., ccsdata/ABAVIJ/)

* The temperature at which the isotherm data is calculated is automatically read from the 
filename ccsdata/ABAVIJ/CO_2/temperatureK.csv
(e.g., ccsdata/ABAVIJ/CO_2/300K.csv)

* Make sure to specify the name of the structure in the coreDB.yml file,
